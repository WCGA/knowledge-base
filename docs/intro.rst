What is the West Coast Ocean Data Portal?
=========================================
The `West Coast Ocean Data Portal <http://portal.westcoastoceans.org/>`_ is a tool that facilitates geospatial data **discovery** and data **sharing** for people and organizations who work on regional ocean and coastal management, policy, and planning on the West Coast of the United States. You can read more about the West Coast Ocean Data Portal here: http://portal.westcoastoceans.org/about/.

The West Coast Ocean Data Portal (WCODP) is a project of the `West Coast Governors Alliance <http://www.westcoastoceans.org/>`_ (WCGA). The WCGA and the WCODP promote communication and knowledge sharing between West Coast ocean data managers, partners, and users, known as the `West Coast Ocean Data Network <http://network.westcoastoceans.org/>`_.  

The West Coast Ocean Data Portal is a unique and valuable resource on the West Coast because it focuses on regional data sets for cross-boundary, multi-discipline, and multi-agency issues such as marine debris, sea-level rise adaptation, oil spill response, and marine spatial planning.  

The WCODP does not store a copy of data sets or metadata.  Instead, it displays key descriptive information about the data and points users to the original source using the metadata as the "road map."

How to Use the Knowledge Base
=============================
The West Coast Ocean Data Portal Knowledge Base is a *technical* resource for data managers and data partners who would like to participate and share their geospatial metadata, data and/or web services with the larger community of West Coast ocean data users.

This Knowledge Base describes: 

* Steps to register_ data in the WCODP; 
* Tips, tools, and best practices for developing good metadata_ and `web mapping services`_; 
* Interoperability of `web catalog services`_; and 
* Details about the technology_ behind the WCODP.

This Knowledge Base is *not* a user guide for end users of the WCODP.
